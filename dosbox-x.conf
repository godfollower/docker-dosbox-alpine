# This is the configuration file for DOSBox-X 2024.03.01. (Please use the latest version of DOSBox-X)
# Lines starting with a # are comment lines and are ignored by DOSBox-X.
# They are used to (briefly) document the effect of each option.

#        fullscreen: Start DOSBox-X directly in fullscreen. (Press [F11/F12]+F to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox-X.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                        Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                        If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                        (output=surface does not!)
#            output: What video system to use for output (openglnb = OpenGL nearest; openglpp = OpenGL perfect; ttf = TrueType font output).
#                      Possible values: default, surface, overlay, ttf, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, openglpp, ddraw, direct3d.
#          autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if DOSBox-X has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for DOSBox-X. Second entry behind the comma is for when DOSBox-X is not focused/minimized.
#                        pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, in favor of scancodes. Might not work on all operating systems.

#                              The on/off/on_fake/off_fake options are intended for testing and debugging DOS development,
#                              or to emulate obscure hardware, or to work around potential extended memory problems with DOS programs.
#                              on_fake/off_fake are intended to test whether a program carries out a memory test to ensure the A20
#                              gate is set as intended (as HIMEM.SYS does). If it goes by the gate bit alone, it WILL crash.
#                              This parameter is also changeable from the builtin A20GATE command.

[render]
#      frameskip: How many frames DOSBox-X skips before drawing one.
#         aspect: Aspect ratio correction mode. Can be set to the following values:
#                     'false' (default):
#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: image is simply scaled to full
#                            window/fullscreen size, possibly resulting in dis-
#                            proportional image
#                         'surface' output: it does no aspect ratio correction,
#                            resulting in disproportional images if VGA mode pixel
#                            ratio is not 4:3 (default)
#                     'true':
#                         'direct3d'/opengl outputs: uses output driver functions to
#                            scale / pad image with black bars, correcting output 
#                            to proportional 4:3 image
#                            In most cases image degradation should not be noticeable
#                           (it all depends on the video adapter and how much the image
#                            is upscaled).
#                            Should have none to negligible impact on performance,
#                            mostly being done in hardware.
#                            For the pixel-perfect scaling (output=openglpp), it is
#                            recommended to enable this whenever the emulated display
#                            has an aspect ratio of 4:3
#                         'surface' output: inherits old DOSBox aspect ratio correction
#                            method (adjusting rendered image line count to correct
#                            output to 4:3 ratio)
#                            Due to source image manipulation this mode does not mix
#                            well with scalers, i.e. multiline scalers like hq2x/hq3x
#                            will work poorly
#                            Slightly degrades visual image quality. Has a tiny impact
#                            on performance.
#                            When using xBRZ scaler with 'surface' output, aspect
#                            ratio correction is done by the scaler itself, so none of
#                            the above apply.
#                   Possible values: false, true, 0, 1, yes, no, nearest, bilinear.
#   aspect_ratio: Set the aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9) in the aspect ratio correction mode. 0:0 means the default ratio of 4:3, and -1:-1 means the original image ratio.
#         scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. Add keyword 'forced', after the name of the scaler to always use the scaler even if the result might not be desired.(e.g. 'normal2x forced')
#                   Appending 'prompt' will cause a confirmation message for forcing the scaler.
#                   To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars.
#                   To fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
#                   Scalers should work with most output options, but they are ignored for openglpp and TrueType font outputs.
#                   Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, normal4x, normal5x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, hq2x, hq3x, 2xsai, super2xsai, supereagle, tv2x, tv3x, rgb2x, rgb3x, scan2x, scan3x, gray, gray2x, hardware_none, hardware2x, hardware3x, hardware4x, hardware5x, xbrz, xbrz_bilinear.

#                       For the dynamic core, both dynamic_x86 and dynamic_rec are supported (dynamic_x86 is preferred).
#                       Windows 95 or other preemptive multitasking OSes will not work with the dynamic_rec core.

#                fpu: Enable FPU emulation

#         rdtsc rate: If nonzero, the Pentium RDTSC counter will tick at this rate per millisecond instead of by the cycle count
#     segment limits: Enforce checks for segment limits on 80286 and higher CPU types.
#            cputype: CPU Type used in emulation. "auto" emulates a 486 which tolerates Pentium instructions.
#                       "experimental" enables newer instructions not normally found in the CPU types emulated by DOSBox-X, such as FISTTP.

#             cycles: Number of instructions DOSBox-X tries to emulate each millisecond.
#                       Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#                       Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#                         'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                                         It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#                         'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
#                                         need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#                         'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                                         handle. Recommended if better performance is desired.
#                       Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#            cycleup: Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with the mapped keyboard shortcut.
#          cycledown: Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
#              turbo: Enables Turbo (Fast Forward) mode to speed up operations.
#            apmbios: Emulate Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS calls.
#         isapnpbios: Emulate ISA Plug & Play BIOS. Enable if using DOSBox-X to run a PnP aware DOS program or if booting Windows 9x.
#                       Do not disable if Windows 9x is configured around PnP devices, you will likely confuse it.
